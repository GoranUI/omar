              purchase details in a practical manner. With these features, it is expected that administrators can

              intuitive and efficient admin interface that supports key functionalities such as viewing user product
              reviews, filtering the product database, and accessing detailed purchase links.</p>
            <p class="p-style">My responsibilities included conducting competitive analysis, creating user flows based
              on admin needs, and translating user stories into user flow, wireframes, and high fidelity design in

                <p class="p-style mt-5">During the discovery step, I did a competitor analysis to see how other
                  platforms handle similar features, like review displays, product filters, and purchase details. From
                  there, I found some common pain points, like reviews that aren't very informative or filters that are
                  confusing. I also studied the main users and audience, who are admins who need quick, efficient, and
                  informative access to product data and user feedback.

                  interaction flow in completing specific tasks, such as filtering products, copying purchase links, and
                  viewing details of products sold. Next, I created a user journey to understand the admin's experience
                  from start to finish when using the system, to ensure that each step felt logical and comfortable.

                  system that included professional and easy to read main colors, clean and responsive typography, and
                  reusable UI components such as buttons, product cards, and input fields. This design system became the
                  visual and interactive basis for the entire admin interface.</p>

                have admin features for product management and product reviews. The focus was on how other platforms

                and user reviews, I conducted a competitor analysis of several tools commonly used in the e-Commerce
                industry. The main focus of this analysis was how each platform displays user reviews, provides product
                filter features, and allows admins to copy purchase-related information. The results of the analysis
                revealed various approaches that can be used as references and comparisons, both in terms of feature
                strengths and potential pain points in the user experience.

              <p class="p-style mt-5 md:ml-7">From analyzing several e-Commerce admin platforms, we identified recurring
                pain points that affect the overall user experience for admins when managing product data and customer
                reviews.<br />
                1. Too many features and data metrics presented at once can confuse new or non-technical users.<br />
                2. Filtering tools are too basic or general, making it difficult for admins to locate specific products
                quickly.<br />
                3. Admins cannot easily copy or share purchase detail links, which slows down documentation or
                communication tasks.<br />
                4. Key admin features like review visibility and filtering are often dependent on external plugins or
                themes, leading to inconsistency in functionality.<br />
                5. Important features such as reviews or purchase links are not centralized or easy to find, requiring
                extra navigation steps.</p>

                performance, customer reviews, and inventory updates.<br />
                2. Most users need efficient tools to help them quickly access, filter, and manage product data without
                unnecessary complexity.<br />
                3. Users appreciate intuitive, clean, and actionable dashboards, so they can focus on the decisions
                rather than thinking about how to use the platform.</p>

          <p class="p-style mt-4">After understanding the issues and user needs, I moved on to the ideation phase by
            creating user flows to map out how admins complete each task in the system, such as accessing product
            reviews, applying filters, and copying purchase links. This user flow helped ensure that every interaction
            was efficient and logical. I then developed a user journey to describe the overall experience from the
            admin's perspective when interacting with these features, including how they navigate between pages,
            understand the information displayed, and complete their goals without confusion. This stage was important
            to ensure that the designed solution was not only functional but also enjoyable to use.</p>

            To maintain visual consistency and ease of future development, I created a design system that serves as a
            reference for designing the entire interface. I chose professional colors that are not too bold, to support
            information visibility without distracting the user's focus. Typography was designed for readability,
            especially for large amounts of text such as reviews or product data. I also created several main components
            such as buttons, input fields, product cards, and tables, which were designed to be reusable and responsive
            so they can be easily adapted to various screen sizes. With this design system, every visual element feels
            consistent, functional, and supports a stable user experience.

              Product review detail that makes it easy for users to understand the position of the page being opened. At

            <p class="p-style">
              Below that, review-related information is displayed in two columns. The left column displays customer data

              containing their reviews. Below that is the review title, written as “Test Review Title,” and several
              product images uploaded by the customer. These images are arranged in a horizontal thumbnail row to

            <p class="p-style">
              Administrators are also provided with the ability to publicly respond to customer reviews via a text field
              labeled “Reply.” A small note below explains that this response will be published publicly. At the bottom
              of the page, there are two action buttons: ‘Cancel’ to cancel changes and “Save” to save the status or

              wrote the review, whether the review includes an image or not, the review status (pending or approved),
              purchase verification status, the time and date the review was created, and an eye icon in the last column
              that likely functions to view the review details. Some data, such as the product name, review title, and
              review content, are displayed in a truncated format with ellipses to keep the layout concise. Review
              statuses like “Pending” and “Approved” are displayed with a prominent color badge for easy recognition.

              feature at the top of the table, as well as an eye icon in the “Actions” column that indicates the option
              to view details of a specific transaction. The design of this page remains consistent with the navigation
              sidebar structure on the left and the header at the top, which lists the active user name (Claire Oxner)
              and the client being served (Andi Grace), keeping the work context clear and efficient.

              This view shows the modal details for one of the boddydigital-5 digital product orders, which appears
              after the user clicks the action icon from one of the entries in the transaction table on the previous
              page. This pop-up is designed to provide in depth information about a specific order with a clean and
              focused interface. At the top, users are presented with the product image, product name, and order details
              such as the order number (ZM-134321) and purchase date (17/08/2020, 23:20:34). File size information and
              the “Change File” option are also available, allowing the admin to replace the digital file associated
              with this order.
            </p>
            <p class="p-style">
              Users are provided with several direct actions: View Order, Download, and Copy link buttons, with the
              download URL available in a field that can be copied. On the right side, there is the order status, which
              is currently Active, with information on the number of downloads (0) and validity period (Expires: Never),
              as well as an option to change the status if needed.
            </p>
            <p class="p-style">
              Further down, there is an Activity Log that records the history of activities related to this order. The
              log table presents data in the columns Activity, Date, IP, User, and Activity Detail. Although the content
              is still a placeholder with the text “Lorem ipsum,” this element illustrates a structured user activity
              tracking system that allows auditing of every action performed on the file. The pagination below the table
              shows that the system records hundreds of log entries, reinforcing the impression that this system is
              designed for large-scale use with complete and neatly documented activity traces.

            <p class="p-style">
              To evaluate the overall effectiveness, ease of use, and user satisfaction levels of the admin platform, I
              conducted a series of moderated usability testing sessions involving participants who represented the role
              of user admins. Each session was designed to reflect real-world usage scenarios, in which participants
              completed a series of goal-based tasks that reflected the workflow of an admin when managing digital
              content and transactions on the platform.
            </p>
            <p class="p-style">
              The primary goal of this usability testing was to observe how admins interact with key features, how
              easily they navigate the interface, and whether design elements such as content structure, button
              placement, and terminology effectively guide users in completing their tasks. I also want to identify
              potential usability issues or friction points that could hinder the overall user experience and ensure
              that the platform supports the needs and expectations of administrators in their work processes.
            </p>
            <p class="p-style">
              During the testing session, participants were given a series of scenarios such as: searching for buyer
              reviews, finding products with the highest ratings in a specific category, using filters to select
              products with specific requirements, sharing information using product links, and checking sales data for
              several products. These scenarios were designed to explore various aspects of the interface and system
              interactions from the perspective of both new and experienced admins.
            </p>
            <p class="p-style">
              By analyzing user behavior, feedback, and performance in completing each task, I gained valuable insights
              to refine the existing design. The findings from this session helped ensure that the product development
              direction fully supports admin needs, while enhancing efficiency and clarity at every stage of system use.
            </p>
            <p class="p-style">
              Participants were given the following scenario to complete:<br />
              1. You want to see reviews from buyers, how do you do that?<br />
              2. You want to find out which products have the highest ratings in a particular category, what should you
              do?<br />
              3. You want to check products based on only a few criteria, so you need a filter for this. How do you do
              that?<br />
              4. You want to share information using product detail links. What can you do?<br />
              5. You want to check sales for several products. How do you check them?
            </p>

            <p class="p-style">
              If I had additional time, I would:<br />
              1. Continue the design iteration process through further usability testing using more structured scenarios
              and task based activities typical of administrators. This approach aims to further validate the
              information structure, visual clarity, and effectiveness of key interactions such as transaction data
              access, download status, and digital product navigation.<br />
              2. Conduct a comprehensive usability review of the design, focusing on UI element consistency,
              readability, and workflow simplification to ensure the admin experience remains intuitive and supports
              their daily workflow efficiency.
