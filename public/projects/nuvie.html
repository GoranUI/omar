This variety of options accommodates different user preferences and makes onboarding more accessible.<br><br>
                
                After successfully signing up, users are guided through a brief onboarding process designed to personalize their experience. This onboarding includes a few simple but meaningful steps, such as entering personal information like a full name and birth date, also selecting content preferences, including favorite genres, movie types, or preferred actors.<br><br>
                
                These inputs help the app tailor recommendations and interface content based on each user’s taste, making the discovery process more relevant and engaging right from the start.<br><br>
                
                Once onboarding is complete, users are granted full access to the Home page, where they can begin exploring streaming options, personalized suggestions, and other key features of NuVIE.<br><br>       
                
                This flow is designed to minimize friction for new users while enhancing the personalization experience from the very beginning, ensuring both ease of use and long term engagement.<br><br>

            <p class="p-style mt-6">
                After successfully logging into the app, users are directed to the Home page, where they can explore a wide range of content categorized by platform, such as Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, and more. This layout provides an easy browsing experience and allows users to quickly find trending or popular shows across different streaming services. <br><br>

                For users seeking more personalized recommendations, they can tap on the NuVIE icon located in the center of the bottom navigation bar. This action leads them to a category selection screen, where they can choose from curated options like Movie Night, Binge Week, or other thematic experiences. Each category is designed to match common viewing moods or scenarios, making it easier for users to find content that suits their current vibe or situation.<br><br>
                
                Once a category is selected, users are taken through a brief and engaging questionnaire, which asks about their current mood, preferred genres, specific themes, or the type of experience they’re looking for (e.g., emotional, thrilling, light-hearted). The design of this flow ensures that the process feels interactive and fun, rather than like a rigid survey.<br><br>
                
                After answering the questions, the system intelligently processes the input and generates a set of content recommendations that are highly tailored to the user’s preferences. These recommendations can then be browsed, watched directly via linked streaming platforms, or saved to their Favorite List for later viewing.<br><br>
                
                This is end to end journey from mood based input to personalized results, not only enhances user engagement but also makes content discovery feel more intentional and emotionally connected.<br><br>

                After receiving a list of recommended movies based on their interests, users can tap on a specific title to view its detailed information. On the detail page, users are presented with various key elements such as the title, subtitle, year of release, IMDB rating, brief description, available streaming platforms, and episode details if it's a series.<br><br>

                If users find the movie interesting and decide to watch it, they can immediately start watching by tapping on the streaming platform logos displayed (e.g., Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, etc.). This provides a seamless and convenient experience, eliminating the need to search for the movie separately on another app.<br><br>
                
                Additionally, users can add the movie to their Favorite List by clicking the heart icon on the top right. The Favorite List feature allows users to manage and categorize their saved movies. To make it more organized, users can create custom folders (e.g., ” “Horror,” or “Weekend Watchlist”) and group their movies accordingly. Each movie card in the favorite list also displays viewing progress, helping users keep track of what they’ve already watched and how much is left.<br><br>
                
                This design enhances personalization and makes content discovery and management more efficient for users who enjoy watching movies across multiple genres and platforms.<br><br>

            <span class="subheading-style">Usability Testing</span>

            <p class="p-style">
                To evaluate the effectiveness and usability of NuVIE, I conducted a usability testing session by preparing a realistic scenario along with task-based activities. The goal was to understand how users interact with the app, identify pain points, and validate whether the designed features align with user needs and expectations.
            </p>
            <p class="p-style">
                Below is the scenario and a series of tasks given to participants during the testing:            
            </p>
            <p class="p-style">
                1. You heard about an app that offers personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences, so you downloaded it. As a new user, you need to answer a few preference questions. What would you do? <br><br>
                2. After reaching the homepage, you see many types of movies and feel overwhelmed. You want to find a movie that matches your current preferences. What steps would you take to find it? <br><br>
                3. After receiving your movie recommendations, you want to check the details of a specific movie. How would you do that? <br><br>
                4. You are interested in one of the recommended movies and want to watch it immediately. What can you do? <br><br>
                5. You’re also interested in several other movies and would like to save them for later. What would you do to make sure they’re stored? <br><br>
                6. You've successfully saved a list of movies you want to watch later, but the list looks unorganized. You want to organize them based on genres. How would you do that? <br><br>
            </p>
            <p class="p-style">
                These tasks were designed to simulate real user goals, ranging from onboarding, navigating content, discovering recommendations, and organizing favorite movies. The test sessions helped validate whether the app’s key features, such as personalized recommendations, direct streaming access, and organized favorite lists were easily discoverable and intuitive to use.
            </p>
            <p class="p-style">
                Through this process, I was able to gain valuable feedback regarding both the user flow and the overall user experience. The insights collected were used to further refine the interface, improve usability, and ensure that the solution truly addresses the initial problem, helping users find movies they enjoy without feeling overwhelmed.

            <span class="subheading-style">Reflection</span>

            <p class="p-style">
                If I had additional time to further develop this project, my main focus would be:<br />
              1. Continue gathering user feedback with a focus on identifying less obvious challenges users face.<br />
              2. Test the prototype in real use scenarios to confirm the ease of navigation and uncover any friction areas.
              <br />
              3. Update and polish the design based on testing outcomes to deliver a more intuitive and enjoyable experience. <br />
