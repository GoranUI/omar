            <p class="p-style">My main focus was to create a page structure that educates users about Imperfect Foods’
              services through visuals that are friendly, informative, and easy to understand. I strategically organized
              each section from the educational headline, product categories, and service explanation, to customer
              testimonials. Additionally, I ensured that all visual elements, such as illustrations, icons, and colors,
              effectively supported the core message and encouraged user actions.

            <p class="p-style">The design also considered accessibility principles and mobile responsiveness to ensure
              an optimal user experience across devices. Every design decision was grounded in user research and the

              <p class="p-style">The design process for this project was divided into four key phases to ensure a user
                centered and results experience:</p>
              <div>
                <span class="subheading-style">Discovery</span>
                <p class="p-style mt-5">In the Discovery phase, I began by conducting competitor analysis to understand
                  the design approaches used by similar services in the food and grocery delivery industry. This
                  analysis helped me identify the strengths and weaknesses of competitors and uncover opportunities for
                  differentiation. I also gathered user pain points related to their shopping experience, such as
                  difficulties in finding affordable healthy products and lack of transparency about product origins. In
                  addition, I defined the target users and audience individuals who care about sustainability and want
                  to reduce food waste through more mindful consumption choices.

                <p class="p-style mt-5">After understanding the problems and user needs, I moved into the Ideation phase
                  by mapping out the user journey. Here, I illustrated the experience from the moment users land on the
                  homepage to the point of signing up to start shopping. The main goal of this process was to identify
                  key touchpoints that needed to be optimized to ensure users feel guided and comfortable. This journey
                  map helped me design an intuitive flow that aligns with the brand's mission and improves the overall
                  user experience.

              <div>

                <p class="p-style mt-5">To maintain visual consistency across the homepage, I developed a Design System
                  that includes color selection and typography. The color palette reflects the brand’s cheerful and
                  inclusive spirit while also emphasizing its sustainability mission through natural tones. The
                  typography was chosen for its readability across different screen sizes while maintaining a friendly
                  yet professional tone. This system served as a foundation for designing all visual components,
                  including buttons, icons, and layout structure.

                <p class="p-style mt-5">In the Usability Testing phase, I began by creating tasks and scenarios that
                  represent real user activities, such as browsing products, understanding the service, and signing up
                  for an account. Although full testing had not yet been conducted at this stage, developing these
                  scenarios was an essential first step to ensure that the design could be tested effectively. These
                  scenarios will later be used to observe user interactions and identify potential usability issues.</p>

              <p class="p-style mt-5">In the first phase of this project, I focused on deeply understanding the problem
                space and the users’ expectations. Since Imperfect Foods operates in the sustainable grocery delivery
                space, the challenge was to design a homepage that not only communicates the brand’s values but also
                builds trust and motivates users to take action. I explored the broader context of food waste, user
                shopping behavior, and the importance of transparency in grocery delivery services. This foundational
                understanding helped shape design decisions that are both user centered and aligned with the brand

            looking for a grocery delivery service that reduces food waste, I developed a scenario based journey to

            In this phase, I developed a design system to ensure visual consistency and scalability across the entire
            interface. The system defines core elements such as color and typography, which reflect the brand’s identity
            and enhance user experience. The color palette combines natural tones with fresh, vibrant accents to
            communicate sustainability while maintaining an engaging and modern feel. Typography was selected for high
            readability across screen sizes, balancing friendliness and professionalism to suit both informative content
            and promotional messaging.
          </p>
          <p class="p-style mb-8">
            Beyond color and text styles, the design system also includes responsive components adapted for both mobile
            and desktop views. Buttons, navigation, cards, and layout grids were designed with flexibility in mind to
            maintain usability and clarity across devices. This system acted as a foundation that streamlined the UI
            design process and allowed for efficient future scaling.

              To evaluate the overall usability, effectiveness, and user satisfaction of the Imperfect Foods homepage, I
              conducted a set of moderated usability testing sessions with participants representing first time visitors
              who were interested in sustainable grocery solutions. Each session was built around realistic and goal
              scenarios to simulate how users naturally approach exploring and evaluating a mission food delivery
              service.
            </p>
            <p class="p-style">
              Participants were given the following scenario to complete:<br />
              1. You’ve recently heard about a product that sells good quality food waste. You want to assess whether
              this platform is truly good to use. How would you find that information?<br />
              2. After browsing the official website, you try to find the product you’re looking for. How do you find
              it?<br />
              3. Upon finding the product, you want to gather information about the positive impact of that product. How
              do you do it?<br />
              4. You’re becoming more interested, but you still feel unsure. So you decide to check the testimonials.
              How do you view them?<br />
              5. After reading the testimonials, you still have a few questions about Imperfect’s features or products.
              How do you get those questions answered?<br />
              6. Once your questions are answered, you feel confident enough to place an order. Now, you want to start
              using the service. What’s the first step you need to take?<br />
            </p>
            <p class="p-style">
              These tasks were designed to test how effectively the homepage communicates the platform’s mission and
              value proposition, the clarity of available information, and the ease of taking further steps such as
              understanding the product categories, reading about social or environmental impact, and beginning the
              order process.
            </p>
            <p class="p-style">
              The testing focused on how users navigated sections such as product offerings, sustainability metrics,

              1. Gather users to conduct usability testing according to the scenarios and tasks created.<br />
