            <p class="p-style">In this project, I worked as a UX/UI Designer responsible for designing the experience
              and visual appearance of the W*nder homepage. My main focus is to build trust and educate users about CBD
              based products, which are still considered sensitive by some people. My design focus is to build trust by
              bringing transparency and education through an engaging and structured visual experience.</p>
            <p class="p-style">My role covers end to end design from user flow, wireframing, UI design, to final
              prototyping by ensuring every visual element and interaction supports the brand's main objectives: build
              trust, educate, and encourage further product exploration. I also maintain consistency in tone & style so
              that the W*nder brand appears unique, trusted, and relevant to new users and those who are familiar with
              CBD.

              <p class="p-style">The design process for this project was divided into four key phases to ensure a user
                centered and results experience:</p>
              <div>
                <span class="subheading-style">Discovery</span>
                <p class="p-style mt-5">In the Discovery phase, I started by conducting a competitor analysis to
                  understand how other CBD brands approach safety and transparency messaging. This analysis helped me
                  identify pain points that are often found in the industry such as a lack of lab test information or a
                  confusing website interface. I also dug deeper into the characteristics of W*nder's users and target
                  audience, including their need for clarity, credibility and education around CBD.

                <span class="subheading-style">Ideation</span>
                <p class="p-style mt-5">Next, I developed a user flow and user journey map to map out how users would
                  navigate the site and interact with the information provided. My main focus was to create a simple yet
                  informative flow, so that users could easily understand the benefits of W*nder and access product test
                  results in just a few steps. This process was crucial to ensure the user experience remained intuitive
                  despite the educational and technical nature of the content.

              <div>
                <span class="subheading-style">Design Process</span>
                <p class="p-style mt-5">Moving into the Design System phase, I designed visual guidelines that are
                  consistent and reflect the brand identity. I chose a warm yet trustworthy color palette to convey a
                  safe and friendly impression, and clean and easy to read typography to support the readability of the
                  information. I also established a neat grid system so that each element on the page has a harmonious
                  visual rhythm and is easy to navigate.

                <span class="subheading-style">Usability Testing</span>
                <p class="p-style mt-5">In the Usability Testing phase, I developed a set of tasks and scenarios to test
                  the effectiveness of the design. Users were asked to run scenarios such as searching for product test
                  results, understanding the benefits of CBD, and finding the variant that suits their needs. From this,
                  I gained valuable insights on which flows needed to be simplified and which elements were successful
                  in attracting users' attention. This feedback was then used to refine the design to be truly user
                  centric and conversion oriented.</p>

                the CBD industry, specifically related to product trust and safety. Amidst the rapid growth of the CBD
                market, many users find it difficult to distinguish legitimate and tested products from those that are
                not. W*nder wanted to assert its position as a transparent and trusted brand by presenting lab result
                information openly. Therefore, I needed to design a digital experience that would convey this message in
                a powerful and accessible way to the target audience.</p>

                how they present information related to product quality and lab test transparency. My focus was on
                elements such as page structure, educational messaging, navigation, and accessibility to test data. This
                analysis helped identify design gaps and opportunities that could be used to strengthen W*nder's
                position against competitors.

            not be familiar with the CBD world. I focused on creating a logical flow that supports the exploration and
            education process, while also paying attention to how visuals and navigation structure can strengthen
            engagement.</p>

              positioning that this CBD product is not just a drink, but specifically designed to help users feel more
              focused, energized and relaxed in their daily lives. The supporting paragraphs below it briefly introduce

              can be consumed at any time, but has the best effect at a certain time. The “Get Breakfast Club” CTA is
              also a follow up path for users who want to engage more deeply, expanding the possibility of long term

              interested in healthy and safe beverage solutions to support work productivity. The participants had an
              interest in CBD-based products, but also had concerns about their safety and health benefits. Therefore,
              the test was designed to simulate how users naturally explore and evaluate products before making a
              purchase decision.
            </p>
            <p class="p-style">
              In each session, participants were presented with realistic scenarios that reflected the user's process of
              deciding. The scenarios given were as follows:<br />
              1. You need a drink that can energize you for work. You hear that W*nder is the solution that can solve
              your problem, but you are not sure if this product is safe for health. So you want to get to know this
              product first. What steps do you take?<br />
              2. After looking at the product information, you feel unsure about consuming it. You need more detailed
              product information. How do you look for it?<br />
              3. By looking at the benefits of the ingredients, you already feel pretty confident but haven't found
              strong information to buy this product. What should you do?<br />
              4. After finding the lab test results, you are very confident to buy this product. How do you buy
              it?<br />
            </p>
            <p class="p-style">
              Through this scenario, the test focused on how users navigated the W*nder home page to find information
              about the product, safety, and health benefits. It also assessed how clearly the brand's values and
              mission were communicated, how easy it was to access information such as lab test results and ingredient
              descriptions, and how easy it was for users to find CTA buttons such as “View Test”, “Get to Know CBD”,
              and “Shop”. The results of this test are expected to identify points of friction, the strength of the home
              page and test result page in building trust with new users, and provide recommendations to improve the
              overall user experience.

              If I had additional time, I would:<br />
              1. Conduct additional user research to explore more issues that may not have been revealed and gain new
              insights from the user's perspective.<br />
              2. Conduct usability testing using the tasks and scenarios that have been created, in order to measure the
              effectiveness of information flow, navigation, and user confidence in the product.<br />
              3. Resolve any issues found and improve areas that are still lacking to make the user experience more
              intuitive and convincing.<br />
              4. Iterate on the design to improve visual quality and functionality, and ensure that the final design
              truly meets the user's needs.
