              on two main scenarios: career search and interview question list exploration.</p>
            <p class="p-style">I designed an intuitive, responsive, and user friendly interface, ensuring an optimal
              user experience across various devices. Throughout the process, I created wireframes, high fidelity
              mockups, and interactive prototypes in Figma to illustrate efficient search flows and information access.
            </p>
            <p class="p-style">Additionally, I organized the information structure systematically to make it easy for
              users to navigate features such as company filters and professional categories. I applied principles of
              visual hierarchy and usability to help users stay focused on their primary goals: finding the right

                <span class="subheading-style">Discovery</span>
                <p class="p-style mt-5">At this step, I analyzed competitors to understand existing approaches in the
                  market. In addition, I identified pain points that users often experience in the job search and
                  interview preparation process. A deep understanding of user needs and target audiences is an important
                  foundation before entering the design phase.

                  users would interact with the product as a whole. The goal was to ensure that each step felt logical,
                  efficient, and aligned with users' needs in achieving their objectives.

                  consistency across all interface elements. Based on the defined structure and flow, I designed a
                  responsive and user friendly final design, focusing on ease of navigation and information readability.

                  usability and effectiveness of the interface. This testing helps identify friction points and areas

              Participants were given the following scenario to complete:<br />
              1. As a job seeker, you want to see what positions are currently available. How do you search for them?
              <br />
              2. You want to know what role you need, like a Marketing. How do you find this information? <br />
              3. You have a dream to work at a certain company, like a Amazon. How do you find this information? <br />
              4. You also want to learn what questions and answers will be asked during the interview. What can you
              do?<br />
              5. You want to know the interview questions and answers specific to the Marketing position. What do you
              do?
            </p>

              These tasks were designed to evaluate the intuitiveness of the content organization, the effectiveness of
              filtering options, and the clarity of guidance materials. By analyzing user interactions, feedback, and
              task completion rates, I gathered critical insights that informed design improvements. The findings
              ensured that the platform meets job seekers’ needs by enhancing accessibility, simplifying information
              discovery, and boosting user confidence throughout their interview preparation journey.

              If I had additional time, I would:<br />
              1. Continued usability testing with the created scenarios.<br />
              2. Conduct an in depth evaluation of visual consistency and responsive design.<br />
              3. Iterate if feedback is received during usability testing.
