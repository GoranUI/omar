                2. Skin irritation: Strong formulas often lead to stinging, redness, or discomfort.<br />

              The first step starts with the use of Duradry PM at night, the product is packaged in sachets and used
              before bed to help reduce night sweat production. The image of the hand holding the sachet shows the
              compact and travel friendly packaging.

            <p class="p-style">
              The second step is Duradry AM, applied in the morning. It is packaged in a small tube and applied to the
              hands, providing all day protection to keep them dry and odor free. The picture shows the direct
              application process to reinforce the usage instructions.

              to better receive the AM and PM products. The visual of a man holding the product gives it a human touch
              and reinforces the impression that it is easy to use by anyone.

              Rosario shared that she has been experiencing excessive underarm sweating since the age of 13, which
              causes stains on her clothes every day in both hot and cold weather. She mentioned that with Duradry, her
              sweating rate decreased by 90% in just a week. The line “It feels weird to not sweat as much as I had the

            <span class="heading-style !mb-6">Usability Testing</span>

            <p class="p-style">
              To evaluate the effectiveness and usability of Duradry, I conducted usability testing sessions by setting
              up realistic scenarios with task based activities. The main objective of the testing was to understand how
              users interact with the application, identify pain points, and validate whether the designed features are
              truly aligned with the needs and expectations of users.
            </p>
            <p class="p-style">
              Participants were given the following scenario to complete:<br />
              1. You are now on the homepage and want to see the main products that Duradry offers. What are you doing
              right now?<br />
              2. Now you want to find out information about the types of products available and what their benefits are.
              How do you do that?<br />
              3. You also want to know how to use Duradry products. How do you find out?<br />
              4. After understanding the product thoroughly, you are still unsure and want to see reviews from other
              people. What did you do?<br />
              5. You are interested in buying it, but you are not sure if you can get free shipping or not, so you want
              to find out this information. How do you do that?

              If I had additional time, I would:<br />
              1. UT will be conducted with specific scenarios and tasks to test information flow, visuals, and clarity
              of CTAs. Feedback from users will be used for design iteration.<br />
              2. If direct UT is not possible, a survey with design screenshots will be created to get initial insight
              from the target audience.<br />
              3. Design evaluation by other designers based on usability principles (such as minimalism, consistency,
              and ease of navigation).
